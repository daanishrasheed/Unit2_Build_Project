            ## The Perfect Playcaller

            What is the best play to call in a given situation?

            Use this app to see which play has the highest chance to be 
            successful given the offense, defense, time left on the clock 
            and the yardline of where the offense is.

            If past trends continue, how can you make the most out of a team's 
            offense to exploit their opponent's defensive weaknesses.
